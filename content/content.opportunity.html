		<!-- Human leukocyte antigens (HLA) is an important component of human immune system that binds to foreign peptides and elicits immune response. Knowing which 
		peptides will be recognized by the HLA system will allow us to artificially induced immune response that specifically target cells containing such peptides,
		essentially creating a vaccine. This has an important implication for cancer patients, whose tumor cells will contain many foreign peptides that result from 
		somatic mutations and are not present in their normal cells. However, because the cost for testing large number of peptides is prohibitive and because peptides
		with low binding affinity to HLA cannot sufficiently elicit immune response, a computational prediction for peptide-HLA affinity with high accuracy is crucial. 
		In this project, we will focus on predicting peptide binding affinity to class II HLA, which is the relevant HLA system for cancer vaccine development, using
		various machine learning techniques. !-->

		<li>A curation and recommendation system for academic software tools.</li>
		<!-- More than 10-20 academic software tools, with varying performances, typically exist for processing or analyzing just a single type of biomedical data.
		This makes selecting the optimal tools quite laborous, especially as some analyses require large amount of computing time and resource. Number of citations
		and journal impact factor generally are good indicators of the quality of an academic software. However, some biomedical research may benefit from less-used 
		tools that were developed to address specific issues. Another scenario is when a popular software has been replaced by an emerging, better-performing 
		alternative. In this project, we want to develope a system for curating and recommending academic software tools that suit user's goals. Major steps will
		involve collection of journal publications, identification of software tools, extraction of information that describes the quality and usage of the tools, 
		and finally recommending appropriate tools given a user input. !-->
