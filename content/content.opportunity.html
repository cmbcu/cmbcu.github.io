              <li>Finding environment-specific genes from a large collection of metagenomics datasets.</li>
              &emsp;We want to develop a data analysis pipeline for mining genes from large collection of metagenomic datasets from > 50 environments
              and classify environment-specific genes. Then, we will explore their functions and evolutionary history.
              <p>
              <li>Chromosomal recombination patterns following whole-genome duplication in fungi.</li>
              &emsp;Chromosomal recombination occurs regularly during meiotic cell division and contributes to the evolution of genomes. Using chromosome conformation data of 
              polyploid yeast that descended from genome duplications or hybridizations, we want to explore the extent that proximity influences recombination pattern.
              <p>
              <li>An optimization approach for generating random graphs that mimic biological networks.</li>
              &emsp;We want to develop new way for generating random graphs with desired properties, and use it to study the pattern underlying some biological networks.
              <p>
              <li>A fast tool for detecting horizontal gene transfers in microbial genomes.</li>
              &emsp;Detection of horizontal gene transfers (i.e. the event where a genomic segment from one microbial species is fused into the genome of another) usually
              require some prior knowledge on the two participating species. Can we develop a new method that can operate, in a timely manner of course, without that input.

              <li>Predicting protein binding affinity from large experiment datasets.</li>
              &emsp;We combine deep neural network with molecular simulation to predict binding affinity between a given protein and a peptide sequence.
              <!-- Human leukocyte antigens (HLA) is an important component of human immune system that binds to foreign peptides and elicits immune response. Knowing which
        peptides will be recognized by the HLA system will allow us to artificially induced immune response that specifically target cells containing such peptides,
        essentially creating a vaccine. This has an important implication for cancer patients, whose tumor cells will contain many foreign peptides that result from
        somatic mutations and are not present in their normal cells. However, because the cost for testing large number of peptides is prohibitive and because peptides
        with low binding affinity to HLA cannot sufficiently elicit immune response, a computational prediction for peptide-HLA affinity with high accuracy is crucial.
        In this project, we will focus on predicting peptide binding affinity to class II HLA, which is the relevant HLA system for cancer vaccine development, using
        various machine learning techniques. !-->

              <li>A curation and recommendation system for academic software tools.</li>
              &emsp;See project #? on the Research page.
              <!-- More than 10-20 academic software tools, with varying performances, typically exist for processing or analyzing just a single type of biomedical data.
        This makes selecting the optimal tools quite laborous, especially as some analyses require large amount of computing time and resource. Number of citations
        and journal impact factor generally are good indicators of the quality of an academic software. However, some biomedical research may benefit from less-used
        tools that were developed to address specific issues. Another scenario is when a popular software has been replaced by an emerging, better-performing
        alternative. In this project, we want to develope a system for curating and recommending academic software tools that suit user's goals. Major steps will
        involve collection of journal publications, identification of software tools, extraction of information that describes the quality and usage of the tools,
        and finally recommending appropriate tools given a user input. !-->
