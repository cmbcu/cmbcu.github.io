                <dd>
                    Merging of distinct genomes into a new organism induces large-scale evolutionary processes that eventually lead to the emergence of species with novel phenotypes and capabilities -- many of which are important in agriculture and biotechnology.<p />
                </dd>
                <dd>
                    Understanding of the mechanisms that drive post-hybridization genome evolution can lead to improvement in the engineering of new hybrid species (such as yeasts) that possess desirable properties.<p />
                </dd>
                <dt>Our approaches</dt>
                <dd>
                    Together with our collaborators in Japan, we recently discovered a group of closely related, recently formed yeast hybrids that serves as a perfect platform for investigating the early stages of post-hybridization evolution.<p />
                </dd>
                <dd>
                    We are employing an integrated analysis of genome sequence, gene expression level, and chromatin structure data.

                <dd>
                    Mass spectrometry technology enables high-throughput identification and quantification of peptides and proteins in a complex sample such as patient's blood and snake's venom.<p />

                <dd>
                    However, analysis of mass spectrometry data typically requires an input database containing known peptides and proteins. In other words, we cannot identify what we did not expect.<p />
                </dd>
                <dd>
                    In many applications, we simply do not know what peptides and proteins would be found and/or the possibilities are too vast to be computationally feasible.<p />
                </dd>

                    We have developed deep neural network models, using millions of mass spectra, for identifying peptides without relying on protein databases. And we are still continuing to improve our peptide <i>de novo</i> sequencing capability even further.<p />

                    Chest radiograph, or chest x-ray, is the most common imaging method for diagnosing diseases - including COVID-19.<p />

                    Increasing availability of public chest radiograph datasets, such as the NIH Chest14, MIMIC, PadChest, and VinDr-CXR, permits development of accurate deep learning models for abnormality classification.<p />

                    However, decisions that impact human life must be not only accurate but also explainable. Our group focuses on improving the explanation of deep classification model and delivering it in the way that radiologist finds useful.<p />
